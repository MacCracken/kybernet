# Kybernet Roadmap

**Current: v1.6.1** — [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) is the record of what each
release actually did. This file carries only what is **not** done.

Everything below came out of a deliberate sweep of the tree after 1.5.9 shipped;
v1.6.0 and v1.6.1 closed the first two sections — twenty-two items. Every item names the file that
proves it. Where a claim was verified by running
something rather than by reading, it says so.

**Pins:** `v1.6.x` is scoped work with a clear finish line. `v1.x.x` is real but needs
a design decision or is too large to date. The last two sections are blocked on
something outside this repo.

`cyrius lint` reports **0 untracked deferrals and 0 warnings** across the tree, and as
of v1.6.1 **CI fails on either** — so this file cannot quietly drift back into fiction.

## v1.6.8 — code that does nothing, and docs that say it does

- [ ] **Port `agnos-init.sh`'s `setup_directories()` to a kybernet oneshot service.**
      Replaces the deleted phase 6b (1.6.2), and it is the *real* form of the need
      phase 6b pretended to serve. `/run` is a fresh tmpfs on every boot
      (`mount.cyr`), so `/run/agnos/{agents,plugins}` and `/run/user/1000` cannot be
      shipped in an image — and `aethersafha`, which kybernet starts **by default** in
      `BOOT_DESKTOP` (argonaut `services.cyr:216`), binds sockets in both
      (`aethersafha/src/apps.cyr:381`, `plugin_host.cyr:468`) and contains no `mkdir`.
      Today AGNOS covers this with a systemd oneshot
      (`agnosticos/config/init/agnos-init.sh:47-62`); kybernet is the PID 1 that
      replaces systemd (`agnosticos/README.md:64`), so the work lands here.
      **Do it as a `"type": "oneshot"` service definition, not as init-resident code** —
      that path is already parsed, wave-ordered, cgroup-placed, supervised and
      harness-gated (six of the nine QEMU fixtures are oneshots), and a service with no
      `security` block runs unconfined as root, so it can `mkdir`/`chown`/`chmod`
      freely. Putting the same capability inside PID 1 would mean a new root-privileged
      filesystem-mutation surface in the least recoverable process on the machine, plus
      a JSON schema, a path validator, a symlink-safe walk and a rule-27 fixture — to
      buy what one config object already buys. This is mostly an agnosticos change.
      ⚠ Two kybernet-side blockers to close first, both real:
        - **A failed prerequisite does not block its dependents.** `start_services`
          (`main.cyr`) starts waves in order, but a wave-N failure only increments
          `failed` — wave N+1 runs anyway. So a broken `agnos-init` would still let the
          confined compositor start and exit 126. This is the item that actually makes
          the oneshot approach trustworthy, and it is worth doing on its own merits.
        - **`aethersafha`'s `depends_on` is hardcoded** in argonaut's
          `default_services(BOOT_DESKTOP)`, so making it depend on a new `agnos-init`
          needs either an argonaut change or a config that replaces the default set.

- [ ] **`MAINPID=` is still parsed, logged and discarded.** The last unhonoured
      sd_notify verb, and the one that cannot be done safely by parsing alone.
      `str_to_int` honours a leading `-` and silently skips non-digits, so
      `MAINPID=-1` yields -1, and `process_kill` has no internal `pid > 0` guard —
      from PID 1 that is `kill(-1, SIGKILL)`, i.e. every process on the machine.
      Needs a bounded parse (rule 25's shape) AND proof the claimed pid is in the
      sending service's own cgroup, because an authenticated sender can still name
      somebody else's pid. The cgroup half is kybernet's to write:
      `/sys/fs/cgroup/kybernet.slice/<svc>/cgroup.procs` is the membership list.
- [ ] **Log the orphan-reap count and assert it (kybernet half).** argonaut 1.13.5 now
      returns the reaped pids (`proc_table_reap_orphans_into`) and reconciles the service
      table against them, so the information exists. kybernet still discards it:
      `init_reap_services`' return is ignored, so a service leaking children produces no
      evidence anywhere. Needs a consumer bump to 1.13.5, a klog line, and then the
      `kyb-orphan` fixture (1.6.1) becomes assertable instead of merely exercised.
- [ ] **`sandbox_from_ruleset` and `_ll_access_to_kernel` are benchmark-only.** Verified at
      1.6.4 while correcting CLAUDE.md rule 9: `_ll_access_to_kernel` has exactly one caller
      (`sandbox.cyr:254`, inside `sandbox_from_ruleset`), and `sandbox_from_ruleset`'s only
      caller in the tree is `src/bench.cyr`. So a chunk of the Landlock surface exists solely
      to be benchmarked. Either give it a production call site or delete it — but note that
      deleting it lowers the recorded benchmark COUNT, which `bench-history.sh` gates on, so
      the removal and the count expectation have to land together.
- [ ] **Per-service health scheduling (argonaut).** 1.6.7 made the poll timer take the
      SMALLEST configured `interval_ms` so nobody is polled slower than they asked — but
      `init_poll_health` checks every service with a health_check on each tick, so a
      service wanting a longer interval is polled more often than it requested. Needs
      argonaut to accept a due-time filter (or to track `last_hc` per service and skip
      the not-yet-due ones internally). Over-polling is wasteful rather than wrong, which
      is why 1.6.7 shipped the floor rather than faking the schedule.
- [ ] **`audit_log_record` RETAINS 240 bytes per crash event (argonaut).** Found while
      fixing the arena leaks at 1.6.5 and deliberately left open: unlike the others this is
      not un-freeable arena, it is live reachable growth — a probe ended with
      `audit_log_len == 1006`, one entry per event, never trimmed. A crash-looping service
      appends forever. Trimming an audit chain is a RETENTION-POLICY decision with security
      implications (an audit log you silently truncate is one an attacker can flush by
      generating noise), so it needs a deliberate answer: a cap with explicit rotation, a
      persist-then-trim, or an accepted bound. Not a mechanical fix.
- [ ] **`is_mounted` is the benchmark that keeps moving, and it is layout-sensitive.**
      Third intervention now. 1.6.1: it scanned the host's REAL mount table and read
      +641% on a CI runner; fixed with a 2 KiB synthetic table. 1.6.8: measured
      ~+12.6% (paired against a clean 1.6.7 worktree, same box: ~4130 vs ~4650 ns)
      from a release that never touched `mount.cyr` — almost certainly `.rodata`
      shift, since that release rewrote 52 log literals from UTF-8 to ASCII. It also
      oscillates between two stable modes on unchanged code. It scans 2 KiB and is
      the most cache-sensitive benchmark in the suite, so it measures binary layout
      as much as it measures the function. Either make it layout-insensitive (much
      smaller working set, or report a median across process restarts) or accept it
      is not a gateable figure and exempt it with the reason stated. The same
      question applies to `strlen(52 chars)`, which showed the identical shape at
      1.6.3 and was never explained.
- [ ] **`seccomp: basic` is measured against a dynamically linked binary only.**
      The dev box stages Arch's dynamic busybox; CI installs `busybox-static`, whose
      glibc start-up issues `readlinkat("/proc/self/exe")` and `prctl` that the
      dynamic path does not. Both are denied `EPERM` and glibc tolerates it, so
      nothing fails — but the local green and the CI green attest to two different
      syscall sets. Decide deliberately whether `basic` covers static linkage, and
      measure whichever answer is chosen rather than widening the list to quiet a
      harmless denial.

---

## v1.x.x — real, but needs a decision or is too large to date

- [ ] **No service can run as non-root.** The whole uid/gid half of `privdrop.cyr` is
      unreachable: `secure_from_context` and `has_cap` have no references anywhere,
      `privdrop_from_context` is called only by the former, `drop_privileges` only by
      those two. There is no `user`/`group` key in `svc_apply_security_json`, and
      argonaut's `ServiceDefinition` has no such field either — the agnostik
      `security_context` bridge is a bridge to nothing. Wants a config key, numeric-uid
      resolution (this tree has no `/etc/passwd` reader), a `drop_privileges` call as
      step 5 of `kyb_pre_exec` — after Landlock, before seccomp — and a fixture that
      prints its own `Uid:`.
- [ ] **The audit chain never rotates and is never drained.** Measured, not estimated:
      **242 arena bytes per record**, `max_capacity` 0 so `_chain_auto_rotate` returns
      immediately, 2000 records → 2000 retained, 0 rotations. argonaut writes on
      kybernet's behalf once per health-checked service per tick, so at the shipped 30 s
      interval that is ~0.68 MB/day/service in the one arena rule 8 says PID 1 never
      resets. Latent only because no shipped config uses `health_check`; it arms the
      first time an operator adds one.
- [ ] **A P(-1) audit.** The last was cut at 1.4.2, seven releases ago. Everything that
      is now the attack surface — `edge_boot`'s exec path, `emergency_auth`'s KDF, the
      security/limits parsers, `restart_queue`, `termios`, and the live
      seccomp/Landlock/capset path — landed after it. Both prior audits found CRITICALs
      every gate was blind to.
- [ ] **Landlock is pinned to ABI 1.** `_landlock_handled_mask()` covers bits 0-12, so
      `REFER` (ABI 2), `TRUNCATE` (ABI 3) and `IOCTL_DEV` (ABI 5) are unrestricted for
      every sandboxed service. The 8-byte `landlock_ruleset_attr` pins ABI 1
      deliberately; nothing records that as a scope decision. Wants a version probe.
- [ ] **No hard CPU bandwidth cap.** kybernet can express `cpu.weight` (relative share)
      but not `cpu.max`, so a service cannot be capped at 0.5 CPU. Mechanical blocker:
      `_cgroup_write_u64` (`cgroup.cyr:425`) emits one integer and `cpu.max` takes
      `"<quota> <period>"`. The same block also documents "plain integers only — no
      `64M` suffixes".
- [ ] **Move the emergency credential out of the world-readable config.**
      `/etc/kybernet/emergency.cred` at 0600 costs almost nothing and defeats a local
      unprivileged reader. It does **not** defeat the image-holder adversary, which is
      why it complements the 1.5.9 KDF rather than replacing it. Changes the config
      surface, so it is its own release.
- [ ] **A dynamic memory ceiling for the KDF.** 1.5.9 caps `m_cost` statically at
      64 MiB, the bottom edge of the band where an anonymous mmap succeeds and the touch
      OOMs. `system_free_memory()` exists (`~/.cyrius/lib/sys.cyr:366`). Deliberately not
      shipped: a bound that depends on free RAM at boot makes a credential valid on one
      board and invalid on another. Revisit if a board under 512 MB appears.

- [ ] **Seven `ServiceDefinition` fields have no config key at all.** `ready_check` and
      `restart_config` are the notable two: argonaut supports them, kybernet's parser
      offers no way to set them, so the readiness and restart-policy surfaces are
      argonaut defaults on every AGNOS board. Needs a decision about how much of
      argonaut's model kybernet intends to expose.

## Needs real silicon — and it is only two things

⚠ **This section used to hold six items and claim all six were hardware-blocked. Four of
them were not** — they were harness investment mislabelled as a hardware wall, which is
the same shape as the "blocked upstream" framing the 2026-08-24 audit retracted for
argonaut. Checked, not assumed:

- [ ] **RPi4 / NUC boot validation.** Genuinely needs the board.
- [ ] **Argon2 cost measured on real ARM.** Genuinely needs ARM silicon or an ARM CI
      runner — `qemu-system-aarch64` under TCG will run the code but its *timings* mean
      nothing, and timing is the whole point of the 1.5.9 work cap. Correctness on
      aarch64 is a different question and is **not** blocked (see v1.6.1).

### Reclassified — harness work, not hardware

Moved into the v1.6.1 gate line. Recording why here so the claim is not re-made:

- **TPM attestation, PCR read, and LUKS2 token unlock.** This QEMU already exposes
  `tpm-tis` and `tpm-crb` (`qemu-system-x86_64 -device help`), and `swtpm` (0.10.1) and
  `tpm2-tools` (5.8) are both in Arch `extra`. `swtpm` is a real TPM 2.0 with real PCRs
  and real sealing — enough to exercise `tpm_detect`, `tpm_read_pcr`, PCR comparison,
  and a sealed LUKS2 token end to end. What a board would add beyond that is a *trusted*
  root, not a *testable* one.
- **`veritysetup open` + read-only mount of the verified target.** `dm-verity.ko.zst`
  and `dm-mod` are present on this host under `/usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/`. The
  actual blocker is narrower than "no device-mapper": Arch's `/usr/lib/initcpio/busybox`
  ships **no `insmod`/`modprobe`** (`busybox --list` confirms), so the initramfs has no
  way to load them. Stage a static loader or the modules, or boot a kernel with DM
  built in. Note this does **not** mean putting a module loader inside PID 1 — that
  remains scaffolding in the one process that must never crash, and stays rejected.
- **Executing the aarch64 seccomp table.** `qemu-system-aarch64` is installed. Whether
  the eight hand-copied syscall numbers are right is a correctness question TCG answers
  perfectly well.

## Blocked upstream / on an external consumer

- [ ] **sigil's `exec_capture` / `exec_vec` fail open and wait unbounded.**
      `agnosys_run_capture` checks only `n < 0`, so an absent or failing `tpm2_pcrread`
      returns `Ok(0)` and sigil zero-fills every PCR — an attestation "pass" from a tool
      that never ran. `agnosys_run_checked` uses `exec_vec`, which standing rule 17
      forbids outright. kybernet's `tpm_read_pcr` call (`edge_boot.cyr:473`) is the last
      unbounded exec in PID 1; `edge_boot.cyr:222` declines it as "not kybernet's to add".
      **That framing is the mistake the 2026-08-24 audit already retracted once** —
      HIGH-1 was filed deferred as "blocked upstream", and the correct fix was to add the
      seam to argonaut. sigil is first-party. This is a sigil release, then a kybernet
      bump.
- [ ] **cyrius stdlib filings, genuinely off-limits from here.** ioctl / termios /
      poll — `2026-08-24-sys-ioctl-wrapper-missing.md`, behind `src/lib/termios.cyr` and
      `_read_line_fd`'s `sleep_ms` poll loop. And `fl_alloc`'s unchecked `_fl_mmap`
      return in two places (`freelist.cyr:404-406`, `:231-241`), which is why sigil's
      own `if (mem == 0)` guards are dead code.
      (The socket-wrapper filing is **closed** — `sys_socket`/`sys_bind`/`sys_recvfrom`
      have landed, so `notify.cyr`'s hand-rolled table moved to v1.6.2 as deletable
      code rather than an upstream wait.)
- [ ] **Control socket for agnoshi runtime commands** — a separate transport surface,
      pinned until an agnoshi consumer drives the protocol shape.
- [ ] **Binary signing on release** — pinned until libro signing/timestamping is
      consumer-driven from outside kybernet's tree.

## History

One line per release. Detail lives in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).

- **v1.6.1** — Gates that could not fail, and the kernel panic the first new one found.
  A fixture with a failing health check made PID 1 SIGSEGV on its first tick: argonaut's
  `init_enforce_watchdog` passed a cstr to `proc_table_pid`, which takes a boxed `Str` —
  and the function had never executed in any release of either repo, because nothing had
  ever configured a `health_check` (so there was no watchdog at all). Fixed in argonaut
  1.13.3 with a test verified to SIGSEGV on the unfixed source. Six gates made able to go
  red: the QEMU harness (was `continue-on-error`, and skipped silently without KVM), the
  bench gate (never run by CI at all), the aarch64 build (no-oped, and release shipped
  without the artifact), the test count (a shrinking suite passed), CI's `raw system()`
  scan (BRE vs ERE — always "clean"), and `cyrius lint`, now hard at 0 deferrals and 0
  warnings. 28 of the harness assertions had never run in CI for want of two apt packages;
  `HARNESS_STRICT=1` makes a skip a failure there. New coverage for orphan reaping,
  structured logging, main.cyr's extracted helpers, and the credential path. Retired two
  broken orphan scripts. The first cut failed its own new bench gate — `is_mounted` was
  scanning the host's real `/proc/self/mounts`, so it measured the runner's mount table
  (+641%) while every other benchmark improved; the calibration normalises CPU speed, not
  how much data the host hands you. Fixed hermetically, and the Argon2 benchmark (memory-
  bound, same class) with it. 632 tests, 45 harness properties, 57 benchmarks.
- **v1.6.0** — The confinement path did not confine, and one of the four ways was
  fatal: `"seccomp": "basic"` had no `execve` on its 37-syscall allowlist and denied
  with `KILL_PROCESS`, so it killed every service it was applied to from 1.4.3 onward
  (verified: SIGSYS). The allowlist gained the measured exec+loader set and the default
  action became `ERRNO(EPERM)` — a hand list is never complete, so an omission must
  degrade rather than execute. Landlock now fails closed instead of reporting success on
  a kernel without it; `_stage_verify_rootfs` is keyed on the verification RESULT (rule
  18) instead of the dm probe; `edge_apply_defaults` clears all five fields so nobody
  inherits a 3-second poweroff budget; a malformed config no longer replaces a running
  one on SIGHUP, and the silent 16 KiB read cliff is a readable error; `enabled: false`
  is skipped rather than counted as a failure that drops the board to an emergency
  shell; unsafe service names are refused at load and on kill/rmdir. New `kyb-seccomp`
  harness fixture — its absence is why this shipped for three releases. 608 tests, 44
  harness properties.
- **v1.5.9** — Salted, memory-hard emergency credential. Argon2id in a self-describing
  `v1$t$m$p$salt$tag` record (agnostic's format, adopted rather than invented);
  `scripts/mkcred.sh` over `openssl kdf`, byte-identical to sigil; parameter bounds are
  rejections, never clamps. sigil 3.12.10 moved the Argon2 lane onto the caller's arena
  (+377 KB link → +25 KB) and took the toolchain 6.5.21 → 6.5.35. Legacy digests still
  verify; both formats gated. 567 tests, 42 harness properties.
- **v1.5.8** — The emergency-auth gate did not work at all: the prompt read fd 0, which
  is `/dev/null` by design, so no password could ever authenticate — and 1.5.7's forced
  `require_auth` made that a reboot loop. Interactive reads now open their own console;
  echo suppression in a new `termios.cyr`; a rejection halts instead of rebooting.
- **v1.5.7** — Edge boot actually verifies, via `veritysetup verify` (pure userspace). An
  absent `edge` block now means detection-only rather than an un-overridable demand.
- **v1.5.6** — Consumed argonaut 1.13.1's arch repairs; no forked service had its own
  session on ARM. Restored two dropped commit pins.
- **v1.5.5** — Cgroup limits actually applied: no controller was ever enabled, and
  `ResourceLimits` is defined twice with incompatible layouts.
- **v1.5.4** — Rust port complete, `rust-old/` removed. Eight dropped behaviours closed,
  including deferred restarts and `$NOTIFY_SOCKET`.
- **v1.5.3** — Lifecycle cleanup: cgroup teardown wired, `reload_config` narrowed,
  refusals reach dmesg.
- **v1.5.2** — Per-service security profiles as config data; capability numbers corrected
  across agnostik and argonaut (both disagreed with the kernel).
- **v1.5.1** — Boot stages that do something; `execute_boot_stage` had been `return 1`
  for all eleven arms.
- **v1.5.0** — Config-driven services; three defects in a start path that had never run.
- **v1.4.3** — 686 lines of security code reachable from nothing reached a production
  path, via argonaut 1.9.0's pre-exec hook.
- **v1.4.2** — P(-1) audit: 20 findings, both CRITICALs gate-invisible (spinning
  timerfds, an x86_64-only `epoll_event` layout). Added the reactor gate.
- **v1.4.1** — Toolchain 6.5.35 + dependency refresh; retired the `path` overrides that
  made tag pins inert.
- **v1.4.0** — THIN sigil surface: 14.35 MB → 0.96 MB.
- **v1.3.x** — Benchmarks became a regression-gated release gate; the 6.0.x → 6.2.11
  leap; agnosys dropped for sigil.
- **v1.2.x** — Edge boot scaffolding: capability detection, PCR reads, the flag gate.
- **v1.1.x** — Modernization: the QEMU PID-1 harness, cgroup path precomputation, the
  fourth P(-1) audit.
- **v1.0.x** — The Rust → Cyrius port and its toolchain rebases.

⚠ The roadmap ITEMS once numbered v1.2.1 and v1.2.2 were never what shipped under those
tags. That work is now v1.5.7 (real verification) and the hardware section above.

**Closed and removed from this file:** the v1.5.9 KDF items (all five shipped);
`drop_cap_sets()` privileged validation (the 1.5.2 `kyb-confined` harness service asserts
`CapEff=0` / `NoNewPrivs=1` as real root under QEMU).
